# Docker Workshop Task
The repo has 2 projects one 
 1. A front end project with react app 
 2. A asp.net core2.2 web api application. 
 
In each of the application folders there is an empty docker file. 
Please complete the docker files and use the docker compose file to run all the containers just like we did in the workshop.

Make sure you create a docker volume by name sqlbackup
Hint: use nginx server to host react app.
